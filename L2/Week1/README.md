# Personal Goals Document - Traders@SMU Alpha Program

*Level 2 (Associate)*


I'm currently pursuing an Asset-Based Lending internship which involves me (not limited to) sorting large datasets and mapping relationships, creating financial models and risk assessments. Thereâ€™s a heavy emphasis on teamwork at the firm and promptly communicating with each other. I also had an internship my freshman year at an Insurance firm which taught me about insurance risk management. I started trading in 9th grade, starting with paper day trading and using indicators like MACD & RSI to identify opportunities. I developed a strategy back then to leverage merger arbitrage for gains which worked in my favor for a ~ 40% return. Quant had my interest because it involved directly working with stocks which I can extend from my personal life into a career. This past summer my interest sparked even more when I came across a TikToker explaining these concepts and found myself heavily intrigued.

I'm interested in the Trading roles and/or Risk mngmt. I'd like to work either at a HFT or Prop firm because they incorporate a fast-paced enviornment that has a thrilling aspect to it, especially HFT. Aditionally I want to be at a firm that prioritizes a positive impact globally, not just profits like imc. In 1 yr I hope to have secured an internship in any quant role so I can have exposure to the sector. In 5 yrs I hope to be working at one of the type of firms I listed, however in 10yrs, I would expect to have left the corporate industry and have my own business (still brewing in what). Up until leaving the industry I'd love to specialize in some sort of enviormental sector at a firm. Additionally, in the short-run I want to conduct research on consumer/retail psychology and have findings on the general effects on consumers based on new generation sentiments such as pumps on Reddit forums, or social media hype.

I'd like to learn how to navigate GitHub properly so I can easily create and contribute to projects. I would also like to improve my understanding of VScode. I want to learn how to solve quant equations without being overwhelmed by the contents (comprehending the BS model and so on). I look forward to executing trading strategies like GARCH models or learning how to use Markov chains to generate alpha. Finally, I'd also love to meet at least 1 quant and listen to their overall experience and understand their unique views on this industry. I hope to build a relationship with a quant beyond career topics based on our interests as it's always fun to get to know others outside technial aspects. The Alpha Program fits into my learning path because it builds on top of the knowledge I've been accumulating since 9th grade and it will help me depoly and further develop skills to mold into a career. Aditionally, being in a group with like-minded individuals who have similar but different goals than me is a good experience since I can foster a space around shared interests.

I would rate myself Beginner in programming, ML, and version control. Intermediate in stat and data analysis. I'm advanced in financial modeling and leveraging certain technical indicators on charts (MACD, RSI, EMA, SMA, VWAP). I would also rate myself as advanced in fundamental LONG term analysis however I am intermediate in short-term analysis and need to improve my understanding on views of the direction of stocks in the short-run (ex: real estate may be booming during a time period but some ppl may understand that it'll fall in the short-term and I need to learn how to identify those opportunities and leverage them).

I plan to dedicate at least 6 hours a week to overall quant. I plan to develop the ability to work through brain-teasers and understand them rather than just memorize tactics to solve them. I also want to be able to build basic ML models (extend my coding abilities). I plan to use YouTube, GitHub open projects, online courses, and personal brokerage platforms to improve my general understanding of the markets and technical tools. I'll measure my progress by noting what skills I currently lack/can improve and comparing my results at the end of the semsester to what I've accomplished through projects. My view of success for the program is walking away with a stronger foundation for quant and intellectually grow from complex concepts I don't understand now. Being able to contribute to a project and see valid results will also count as success for me as it entails sharpening my skills but also working with other memebers and understanding/learning about their view on this space.
